# ZHU-Base-Files
This is the combined hub for updates to the Houston Sector, Alias and POF files. All updates should be submitted as pull requests here, and if the request is to delete/change something, include why the change is needed. Files should be named in accordance with the current AIRAC cycle (Ex 2106) and if multiple updates are within a cycle, a letter should be added (Ex 2106a, 2106b).

## Sector

The Sector file should be saved as .sct2 (Never .sct). The Sector file is used to display all maps, diagrams and fix/VOR/NDB/Airport Locations. This file is where most updates will be used, and is where Airport Diagrams should be saved in [REGIONS] Format.

## Alias

The Alias file should be saved as .txt This file is used for all commands that can be used by the controller. Common ones include .aptpdc (PDC for the code of an airport '.iahpdc') or .awdadctr (This shows the instructions for the center controller on the AWDAD arrival). Any Alias commands are recommended to be submitted if found useful.

## POF

The POF affects how a controller views adjactent controllers. This file uses frequency, controller ID and squawk ranges, and thus should be carefully edited.
